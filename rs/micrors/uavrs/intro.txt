====== Low Budget UAVs ======

Quite a number of remote sensing tasks have shown the usability of this platforms for cost savings obtaining of high-resolution imagery.They are extremely useful for rapid response applications.An important goal ie in biology, forestry and ecosystem research is the monitoring of vegetated areas as forests, fields or renatured river sections. Talking about low budget starts with a simple integrated RGB camera, external action cams with modified lenses from about 100 - 500 € up to highly integrated VIS/NIR cam configurations up to 3000 €. All together a low budget UAV has a range from 400 € up to 5000 €. It should be noted that we are addicted to less is more. The aim of this part of the wiki is to show the success and problems of such experiments, pointing to processing algorithms and results.

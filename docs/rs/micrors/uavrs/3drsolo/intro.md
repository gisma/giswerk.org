# 3DR Solo 

The 3DR Solo has been the most promising competitor of the DJI drones. Unfortunately the development and the hybris of the CEOs [crashes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/10/05/3d-robotics-solo-crash-chris-anderson/#5d4fb9d48406) the 3DR Company . So soon it won't be available anymore. 

Nevertheless you will find here some usefull hints that my help as long as you operating a Solo if you are in trouble with your Solo.

## Groundstations


There are several possibilities to fly a 3DR Solo or to manipulate the settings and flightplans. The most simple way is to use the Android based apps  like ''[ DroidPlanner 2](https///play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.droidplanner&hl=de)'' or the ''[Tower](https///play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.droidplanner.android&hl=de)'' App which provides an easy way to control the Solo parameters. 
Alternatively you may choose the ''[APM Planner 2.0](http://ardupilot.org/planner2/)'' or the ''[Missionplanner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-overview.html)''. Both are powerful and highly reliable groundstations for the 3DR Solo as well as all Pixhawk based copters.
